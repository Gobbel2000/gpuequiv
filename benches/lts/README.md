# Sources of Benchmark LTS files

These are from the
[VLTS Benchmark Suite](https://perscido.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/datasets/DS100),
jointly created by CWI/SEN2 and INRIA/VASY as a CADP resource.
Published 2018 via Perscido-Grenoble-Alpes.

The exception is the file `peterson_mutex_weak.csv`
which is taken from the benchmark files by B. Bisping
[here](https://github.com/benkeks/equivalence-fiddle/blob/42e9e43a5cb9fefef94b9b78ec1019fa9ef86adc/shared/src/test/assets/other/peterson_mutex_weak.csv).
The VLTS systems in CSV format are also taken from that place.
